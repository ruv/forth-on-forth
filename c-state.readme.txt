Load "c-state.repl.index.fth" and run "repl" word.



Coments and parsing words works properly:

  : foo ." adding some semantics" c{ ( x -- ) if ." true" else ." false" then }c ; immediate

  : bar foo ; 1 bar


Even "cs-roll" works as expected, so the "else" word can be defined as the following:

  : else c{ ahead [ 1 cs-roll ] then }c ; immediate
